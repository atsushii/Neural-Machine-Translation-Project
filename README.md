# voice_translation_project

This project is able to translate English speech to japanese speech
I am using NLP for text transaltion and CNN for speech recognition.

Nowadays there are more than 6000 spoken languages in the world.
In fact we can't understand all of them, but we must involve with people who speak different language
because the society is growing globally.
We know that learning different languages are needed a lot of time.

So I will try to solve these problems using deep learning technic.

**Text Translation**

I am using seq2seq model which is usually usu for machine translation, speech recognition and text summarization.
My model architecture is Encoder-Decoder with attention.

1, embedding layer
2, hidden layer (LSTM)

including above layers.
