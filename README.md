# voice_translation_project


**Overview**
Nowadays there are more than 6000 spoken languages in the world.
In fact we can't understand all of them, but we must involve with people who speak different language
because the society is growing globally.

Specifically We must understand the detail of sentences properly when we chat with other people
Also we know that learning different languages are needed a lot of time.

Deep learning is a powerful technique that can be used to solve this problem.
I am using NLP for text transaltion and CNN for speech recognition.

In this project, try to translate English speech to japanese speech.
Users are able to chat with Japanese speakers easily.
you can just speack your native languages (English)
you donâ€™t need to spend time to use a dictionary to translate your language.

**Text Translation**

I am using seq2seq model which is usually usu for machine translation, speech recognition and text summarization.
My model architecture is Encoder-Decoder with attention.

Dataset : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/jesc/index.html
this dataset is already used sentencepiece.
